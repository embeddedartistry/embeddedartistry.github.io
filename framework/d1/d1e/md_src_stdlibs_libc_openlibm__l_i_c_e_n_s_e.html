<div class="textblock"><p>OpenLibm contains code that is covered by various licenses.</p>
<p>The OpenLibm code derives from the FreeBSD msun and OpenBSD libm implementations, which in turn derives from FDLIBM 5.3. As a result, it has a number of fixes and updates that have accumulated over the years in msun, and also optimized assembly versions of many functions. These improvements are provided under the BSD and ISC licenses. The msun library also includes work placed under the public domain, which is noted in the individual files. Further work on making a standalone OpenLibm library from msun, as part of the Julia project is covered under the MIT license. The test files, <a class="el" href="../../df/d55/test-double_8c.html">test-double.c</a> and <a class="el" href="../../d5/dee/test-float_8c.html">test-float.c</a> are under the LGPL.</p>
