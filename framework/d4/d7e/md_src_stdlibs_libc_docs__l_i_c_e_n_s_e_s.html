<p>Portions of this software are derived from third-party works licensed under terms compatible with the above MIT license:</p>
<p>The TRE regular expression implementation (src/regex/reg* and src/regex/tre*) is Copyright © 2001-2008 Ville Laurikari and licensed under a 2-clause BSD license (license text in the source files). The included version has been heavily modified by Rich Felker in 2012, in the interests of size, simplicity, and namespace cleanliness.</p>
<p>Much of the math library code (src/math/* and src/complex/*) is Copyright © 1993,2004 Sun Microsystems or Copyright © 2003-2011 David Schultz or Copyright © 2003-2009 Steven G. Kargl or Copyright © 2003-2009 Bruce D. Evans or Copyright © 2008 Stephen L. Moshier and labelled as such in comments in the individual source files. All have been licensed under extremely permissive terms.</p>
<p>The ARM memcpy code (src/string/arm/memcpy_el.S) is Copyright © 2008 The Android Open Source Project and is licensed under a two-clause BSD license. It was taken from Bionic libc, used on Android.</p>
<p>The implementation of DES for crypt (src/crypt/crypt_des.c) is Copyright © 1994 David Burren. It is licensed under a BSD license.</p>
<p>The implementation of blowfish crypt (src/crypt/crypt_blowfish.c) was originally written by Solar Designer and placed into the public domain. The code also comes with a fallback permissive license for use in jurisdictions that may not recognize the public domain.</p>
<p>The smoothsort implementation (<a class="el" href="../../d0/df4/src_2stdlib_2qsort_8c.html">src/stdlib/qsort.c</a>) is Copyright © 2011 Valentin Ochs and is licensed under an MIT-style license.</p>
<p>The BSD PRNG implementation (src/prng/random.c) and XSI search API (src/search/*.c) functions are Copyright © 2011 Szabolcs Nagy and licensed under following terms: "Permission to use, copy, modify, and/or distribute this code for any purpose with or without fee is hereby granted. There is no warranty."</p>
<p>The x86_64 port was written by Nicholas J. Kain and is licensed under the standard MIT terms.</p>
<p>The mips and microblaze ports were originally written by Richard Pennington for use in the ellcc project. The original code was adapted by Rich Felker for build system and code conventions during upstream integration. It is licensed under the standard MIT terms.</p>
<p>The mips64 port was contributed by Imagination Technologies and is licensed under the standard MIT terms.</p>
<p>The powerpc port was also originally written by Richard Pennington, and later supplemented and integrated by John Spencer. It is licensed under the standard MIT terms.</p>
<p>All other files which have no copyright comments are original works produced specifically for use as part of this library, written either by Rich Felker, the main author of the library, or by one or more contibutors listed above. Details on authorship of individual files can be found in the git version control history of the project. The omission of copyright and license comments in each file is in the interest of source tree size.</p>
<p>In addition, permission is hereby granted for all public header files (include/* and arch/*/bits/*) and crt files intended to be linked into applications (crt/*, ldso/dlstart.c, and arch/*/crt_arch.h) to omit the copyright notice and permission notice otherwise required by the license, and to use these files without any requirement of attribution. These files include substantial contributions from:</p>
<p>Bobby Bingham John Spencer Nicholas J. Kain Rich Felker Richard Pennington Stefan Kristiansson Szabolcs Nagy</p>
<p>all of whom have explicitly granted such permission.</p>
<p>This file previously contained text expressing a belief that most of the files covered by the above exception were sufficiently trivial not to be subject to copyright, resulting in confusion over whether it negated the permissions granted in the license. In the spirit of permissive licensing, and of not having licensing issues being an obstacle to adoption, that text has been removed. </p>
